# SUPER VERY VERY FUN TIME TOOL FOOOOOOO !!

## I made very useful (or pointless) tool.

At least it's useful to me.
By the way, I have very*1000 poor English. Thank you.

## Requirements

(I tested only with Ubuntu and Bash on WSL2.)

1. A computer.
1. Ubuntu (or other awesome distributions)
1. bash (I think you can probably run it in Zsh, but not in Fish.)
1. A mind that accepts risk.

## Installation

1. Oops! This project still in progress. You will have to wait for completion of my tasks.

## Anything Else

Have a nice day! :D
